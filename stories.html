        <h2>Interesting facts about him</h2>

<button class="accordion">5 things you need to know about Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers'</button>
<div class="panel">
        <strong>1. Vincent wanted to be known as the painter of sunflowers</strong> <p>Just like other painters working at the time, Vincent made flower still lifes. But he did things a little differently. After practising with different flowers, he chose a specific variety: the sunflower. His fellow painters thought that sunflowers were perhaps somewhat coarse and unrefined. But this is exactly what Vincent liked, and he also enjoyed painting flowers that had gone to seed. He gave sunflowers the lead role in several paintings.</p>
        Vincent knew that his sunflower paintings were special. As did other people. After he died, friends brought sunflowers with them to his funeral. Sunflowers became synonymous with Vincent, just as he had hoped.


        <p><strong>2. There are 5 different versions of Sunflowers in a vase</strong></p><p>Vincent is famous in all corners of the globe for his painting of sunflowers in a vase. But many people do not realise that he made multiple versions of this painting. These five artworks are now found at museums all around the world, from Tokyo to Amsterdam.
        In addition to these five famous versions of Sunflowers, he painted another two versions. One is in private hands, and the other painting was unfortunately lost during World War II.</p>


        <p><strong>3. Van Gogh’s sunflower paintings were colour experiments</strong></p><p>Vincent started painting flower still lifes to experiment with colour. Flower still lifes also sold well, which was another reason to paint them. Once Vincent had seen the fresh, colourful paintings of the Impressionists in Paris, he also wanted to introduce more colour into his work.
        His initial flower still lifes still had traditional colours, but Vincent tried out increasingly more extreme colour contrasts.</p>


        <p><strong>4. Vincent decorated Gauguin’s room with his sunflower paintings</strong></p><p>Vincent made his first still lifes of sunflowers in Paris. The painter Paul Gauguin was impressed by them. Vincent was very honoured to hear this. He had recently got to know Gauguin and looked up to him. For precisely this painter to appreciate his work confirmed his feeling that he was on the right track.
        Not long after, Vincent moved to the South of France. He wanted to establish an artists’ community there: a place where artists could live and work, and inspire each other. When he heard that Gauguin would actually be coming, he painted several still lifes of sunflowers with which he decorated the guest bedroom. Gauguin called the paintings ‘completely Vincent’.</p>

        <p><strong>5. The ‘Sunflowers’ were meant to symbolise gratitude</strong></p><p>Vincent wanted to combine two versions of the Sunflowers with Woman Rocking the Cradle, the portrait that he made as an homage to the comforting mother figure. Together, the paintings were to form a triptych. The two Sunflowers were the ‘yellow panels’ that would intensify the colours of the portrait. Vincent thought that the triptych as a whole symbolised gratitude.</p>

<button class="accordion">Where is ‘The Starry Night’?</button>
<div class="panel">
        <p><strong>Van Gogh's rolling night sky full of bright stars is probably one of the world's most famous artworks.</strong> </p>
        <p>The Starry Night's home is at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But how did it get there?</p>
        <p>Vincent sold only a handful of artworks during his lifetime. When Vincent passed away, his brother Theo inherited all the remaining ones. Yet when Theo died shortly after, they all fell into the hands of Theo's wife Jo and their only son.</p>
        <p>In order to establish Vincent's recognition in the art world, Jo strategically sold artworks to influential art collectors or well-known museums.</p>
        <p>One day, Jo sold The Starry Night to Georgette van Stolk in Rotterdam. Then in 1941, MoMA acquired it from her. It was the first Van Gogh to enter a New York museum collection.</p>

<button class="accordion">Van Gogh's Illness, <em>In short </em> </button>
<div class="panel">
        <p><strong>Vincent dreamed of establishing an artists’ community at his house in Arles, in the South of France. </strong></p> 
        <p>He invited various artists to join him. Paul Gauguin was ultimately the only artist to take up Vincent’s offer.</p>
        <p>Vincent was delighted that Paul Gauguin agreed to travel south. The two artists worked closely together for a while, but their discussions became increasingly heated.</p>
        <p>They had different ideas about art. Tensions rose high. Vincent was worried that Gauguin would leave. His dream of an artists’ community would then fall to pieces.</p>
        <p>After a furious row, Vincent got very confused. In a fit of madness, he cut off his ear. He ended up in hospital.</p>
        <p>Félix Rey was the physician who treated Vincent. He drew a diagram showing how Vincent had cut off his ear.</p>
        <p><em>'I well knew that one could break one’s arms and legs before, and that then afterwards that could get better but I didn’t know that one could break one’s brain and that afterwards that got better too.</em></p>
        <p>To Theo, 28 January1889</p>
        <p>The ear incident was the result of Vincent’s first major mental breakdown. More of these attacks would follow. What illness was he suffering from?</p>
